        <p class="about">
            I have worked on a series of coding projects, most of which you can find on my <a href="https://gitlab.com/BiriBiri12">gitlab</a>, however I also have a list of the projects, with short descriptions of each, below, all of which are open source. <br><br>
            <a href="https://gitlab.com/BiriBiri12/qtdnd">QtD&D</a> is an application I made primarly to get my feet wet with Qt, however it also works as a fully functional dice roller for D&D, even allowing you to input character stats.<br>
            <a href="https://gitlab.com/BiriBiri12/skyenet">Skyenet</a> is the website you're currently viewing, mostly just as a personal way to express myself.</br>
            <a href="https://gitlab.com/14606a/punch-out">Tropical Punch</a> is the code for a vex robot I and one of my friends worked on during High School for the vex Turning Point competition. <br>
            <a href="https://gitlab.com/14606a/comet-puncher">Comet Puncher</a> is the code for a vex robot that team 14606A made for the Vex Worlds Turning Point Competition, bringing us to qualifications!
