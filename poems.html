          <h4><b>The Beach</b></h4>
          I tread over brimstone sand and into a blazing blue tent. <br>
          The well-fitting swim shirt remains baggy to my heart, <br>
          and my leg hair stabs gruesomely, mercilessly. <br>
          It's flashing through my mind: the fantasy of tearing <br>
          through vocal cords. <br>
 <br>
 A dying name is called, and blood sprays from <br>
 veins; whether mine or theirs, I can't tell. <br>
 My eyes have been scorched by the sun to <br>
 avoid the bikini-clad women. Their curves <br>
 and edges were things my hulking mass <br>
 couldn't grasp. <br>
 <br>
 Just another pair of guys: <br>
 the straight couple of my future boyfriend and me. <br>
 The fan-service-filled beach episode corrupted <br>
 into a boy's club of testosterone tear gas. <br>
 It's flooding my lungs, and I'm gagging <br>
 on smoking rage at my own putrid corpse. <br>
 <br>
 "It will only be two hours," <br>
 but with the melting minute hand, <br>
 each seconds takes forever. <br>
 The fiery sand is scorching <br>
 as my body grinds against my brain: <br>
 two incongruous gears forced <br>
 to work together. <br>
 <br>
 The pyre burns below, and my mind runs. <br>
 It's a world where an ice skater of estrogen ambrosia <br>
 is flowing through me. I'm sitting next to Reiner. <br>
 I'm opening presents of dolls, not trains. I'm wearing <br>
 flashy dresses to middle-school prom. <br>
 I'm happily playing on the beach.

 <h4><b>A Boy and a Girl</b></h4> 
 In the Sixth Grade, two eyes met. <br>
 Boy and girl, in the hallway. <br>
 Then, a push and pull, the crowd moved them. <br>
 But, as if in a spell, their eyes didn't stray. <br>
 <br>
 In the Eight grade, Valentine's Day: <br>
 The boy, his face as read as a heart, <br>
 gave her a letter and some chocolate. <br>
 She smiled, and responded with a homemade tart. <br>
 <br>
 In the Ninth grade, a package arrived. <br>
 The boy's Mom looked at him. <br>
 "And what might this be?" <br>
 "A gift for my girlfriend, a skirt with a long trim." <br>
 <br>
 In her house, the girl had a birthday party. <br>
 The boy nervously gave her a a gift. <br>
 The girl tore it open, her face a grin.  Inside was a brand new book, "Adventures at the Cliff." <br>
 <br>
 In the Tenth grade, the girl camped out <br>
 at the boy's house, on his birthday. <br>
 Then, a girl she didn't know left the house. <br>
 The girl followed the stranger. <br>
 <br>
 In the Twelfth grade, the boy came to school. <br>
 His face blushing fiercely, he looked at the girl. <br>
 The girl smiled mischievously, and motioned for him to spin. <br>
 The boy, wearing a skirt, makeup, and a wig did a twirl. <br>
 <br>
 In college, two girls walked hand in hand. <br>
 Grinning ear to ear, they looked so deeply <br>
 into each other's eyes that it seemed almost murderous, <br>
 but intertwined hands told the story plainly. <br>
 <br>
 In a church, two brides approached each other. <br>
 Lifting their veils, a kiss to seal a contract. <br>
 Looking into their eyes, each said <br>
 the whispered opinion, "I love you," now a fact.

 <h4><b>Who Am I</b></h4>
 Who the hell am I? <br>
 Sitting in an enigma of fog and confusion, <br>
 my life is a series of masks <br>
 perhaps, or is it the truth, pure and simple? <br>
 <br>
 I sit in an enigma of fog and confusion. <br>
 Am I a studious genius or a lazy idiot? <br>
 Or are they both the truth, pure and simple? <br>
 That doesn't make much sense, but neither do I? <br>
 <br>
 Am I a studious genius or a lazy idiot? <br>
 I think they might both be true, like Schrodinger's cat. <br>
 That doesn't make much sense, but neither do I. <br>
 If that's true, the identity is determined by the observer. <br>
 <br>
 I think these might both be true, like Schrodinger's cat: <br>
 I'm a model student and a societal outcast. <br>
 Which means, the identity is chosen by the observer. <br>
 But then, without an observer, what am I? <br>
 <br>
 I'm a model student and a societal outcast. <br>
 I put on masks to satisfy others. <br>
 But then, without the others, what am I? <br>
 Remove the mask, and what lies beneath? <br>
 <br>
 I put on masks to satisfy others. <br>
 My life is simply a series of masks. <br>
 Remove the mask, and who is underneath? <br>
 Who the hell am I? 
<hr> 
 Decent? Virtuous? <br>
 Not just now, <br>
 putting my aptitude to the test. <br>
 So self-absorbed as to be negligent: <br>
 the devil. <br>
 "To think you'd even play a natural born killer." <br>
 We belonged to completely different worlds. <br>
 I'd lost count of how many times I'd asked the question. <br>
 "What do you want?"

 <h4><b>Gentoo Solves Everything</b></h4>

 So right now I will advise you: <br>
 why don't you just install Gentoo? <br>
 <br>
 Drivers failing, connection's weak. <br>

 You just need an OS that strikes true? <br>
 Why don't you just install Gentoo? <br>
 <br>
 You hate yourself? You want to die? <br>
 Well instead of shriveling up to cry, <br>
 you could just find something useful to do: <br>
 why don't you just install Gentoo? <br>
 <br>
 Your spouse has left, you're done with life, <br>
 you're bankrupt, all you've got: a knife. <br>
 The tip pointed at your chest, aimed true. <br>
 Why don't you just install Gentoo?
